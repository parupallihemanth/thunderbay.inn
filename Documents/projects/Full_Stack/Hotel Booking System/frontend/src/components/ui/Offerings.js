                    Thunderbay is known for its famous classical musicians,
                    historical buildings, stunning landscape, world-known skiing
                    resorts and coffee-house-tradition. But apart from the most
                    obvious, there are many other must-visit destinations one
                    shouldnâ€™t miss when on a holiday in the land of Symphonies
                    and shiny glass crystals.
